    This paper presents a formal foundation to systematically decompose QP-based centralized nonlinear controllers into a 
    network of lower-dimensional local QPs, with application to legged locomotion. 
    The proposed approach formulates a feedback structure between the local QPs and assumes a one-step communication delay protocol. 
    The effectiveness of the analytical results is evaluated through rigorous numerical simulations and various experiments on a quadrupedal robot, 
    with the result being robust locomotion on different terrains and in the presence of external disturbances. 
    The paper shows that the proposed distributed QPs have considerably less computation time and reduced noise propagation sensitivity than the centralized QP.

  The MPC framework is developed for an innovative reduced-order linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model that is augmented with the tail dynamics. 
  At the lower level of the control scheme, a nonlinear controller is implemented through the use of quadratic programming (QP) and virtual constraints to force the full-order dynamical model to track the prescribed optimal trajectories of the COM and tail.

  It is shown that the event-based nature of the proposed MPC approach can significantly reduce the computational burden associated with the real-time implementation of MPC techniques.

  <p class="indent-para">The actuators in humanoid robots inevitably have compliance in their joint mechanisms. 
  The joint elasticity often negatively affects static and dynamic performance of the robot. 
  In the specific case of humanoid walking, the elasticity in the actuators can create problems not only on the performance but also on the stability, which is most critical for walking. 
  We modeled the joint deformation and proposed its compensation method to improve walking control performance and stability. 
  The proposed algorithm is implemented on our humanoid robot and its performance is demonstrated by improved stability of walking.</p>

  <p class="indent-para">We made an application of a robot manipulator to perform Cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in emergency situations. CPR is one of the most important treatments which serves to save patients in cardiac arrest. 
  The proposed robot CPR system attempts to overcome the limitations of current CPR methods in two aspects. 
  First, it can provide much more consistent CPR than humans in terms of strength and timing. Second, biological data of a patient can be used to determine the best compression point during CPR. 
  The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated through experiments: one simulation on a mannequin and two animal tests. 
  It is also expected that this robotic CPR system can be a good platform to investigate many aspects of CPR methods and guidelines with accurate measurements and actions. We collaborated with Seoul National University, College of Medicine. </p>

<!--<h2>Online Multi-Robot Exploration of a Translating Plume of Unknown Size and Shape</h2>

<p>In this work, we study the problem of exploring a translating plume with a team of aerial robots. The shape and the size of the plume are unknown to the robots. The objective is to find a tour for each robot such that they collectively explore the plume. Specifically, the tours must be such that each point in the plume must be visible from the field-of-view of some robot along its tour. We propose a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)-based algorithm that yields a constant competitive ratio for the exploration problem. The competitive ratio is \(\frac{2(S_r+S_p)(R+\lfloor\log R\rfloor)}{(S_r−S_p)(1+\lfloor\log R\rfloor)}\) where \(R\) is the number of robots, and \(S_r\) and \(S_p\) are the robot speed and the plume speed, respectively. We also consider a more realistic scenario where the plume shape is not restricted to grid cells but an arbitrary shape. We show our algorithm has \(\frac{2(S_r+S_p)(18R+\lfloor\log R\rfloor)}{(S_r−S_p)(1+\lfloor\log R\rfloor)}\) competitive ratio under the fat condition. We empirically verify our algorithm using simulations.

<p>We study two multi-robot assignment problems for multi-target tracking. We consider distributed approaches in order to deal with limited sensing and communication ranges. We seek to simultaneously assign trajectories and targets to the robots. Our focus is on local algorithms that achieve performance close to the optimal algorithms with limited communication. We show how to use a local algorithm that guarantees a bounded approximate solution within \(\mathcal{O}(h\log 1/\epsilon)\) communication rounds. We compare with a greedy approach that achieves a 2–approximation in as many rounds as the number of robots. Simulation results show that the local algorithm is an effective solution to the assignment problem.

<br>
<p>We study the problem of searching and tracking a collection of moving targets using a robot with a limited Field-Of-View (FOV) sensor. The actual number of targets present in the environment is not known a priori. We propose a search and tracking framework based on the concept of Bayesian Random Finite Sets (RFSs). Specifically, we generalize the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter which was previously applied for only tracking problems to allow for simultaneous search and tracking. The proposed framework can extract individual target tracks as well as estimate the number and spatial density of the targets. We also show how to use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to extract and predict nonlinear target trajectories in this framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques through representative simulations where we also compare the performance of two active control strategies.
