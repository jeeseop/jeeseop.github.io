  The aim of this work is to define a planner that enables robust legged locomotion for complex multi-agent systems.
  <!-- consisting of several holonomically constrained quadrupeds.  -->
  To this end, we employ a methodology based on behavioral systems theory to model the sophisticated and high-dimensional structure induced by the holonomic constraints. 
  The resulting model is then used in tandem with distributed control techniques.
  <!-- such that the computational burden is shared across agents while the coupling between agents is preserved.  -->
  Finally, this distributed model is framed in the context of a predictive controller, resulting in a robustly stable method for trajectory planning. 
  <!-- This methodology is tested in simulation with up to five agents and is further experimentally validated on three A1 quadrupedal robots subject to various uncertainties including payloads, rough terrain, and push disturbances.   -->

  <!-- We made an application of a robot manipulator to perform Cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in emergency situations.  -->
  CPR is one of the most important treatments which serves to save patients in cardiac arrest. 
  The proposed robot CPR system attempts to overcome the limitations of current CPR methods in two aspects. 
  First, it can provide much more consistent CPR than humans in terms of strength and timing. 
  Second, biological data of a patient can be used to determine the best compression point during CPR. 
  The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated through experiments: one simulation on a mannequin and two animal tests. 
  <!-- It is also expected that this robotic CPR system can be a good platform to investigate many aspects of CPR methods and guidelines with accurate measurements and actions.  -->
  We collaborated with Seoul National University, College of Medicine. </p>
