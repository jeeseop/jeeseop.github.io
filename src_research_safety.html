  This paper presents a safety-critical approach to the coordinated control of cooperative robots locomoting in the presence of fixed (holonomic) constraints. 
  To this end, we leverage control barrier functions (CBFs) to ensure the safe cooperation of the robots while maintaining a desired formation and avoiding obstacles. 
  <!-- The top-level planner generates a set of feasible trajectories, accounting for both kinematic constraints between the robots and physical constraints of the environment.  -->
  This planner leverages CBFs to ensure safety-critical coordination control, i.e., guarantee safety of the collaborative robots during locomotion. 
  <!-- The middle-level trajectory planner incorporates interconnected single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to generate optimal ground reaction forces (GRFs) to track the safety-ensured trajectories from the top-level planner while addressing the interconnection dynamics between agents. 
  Distributed low-level controllers generate whole-body motion to follow the prescribed optimal GRFs while ensuring the friction cone condition at each end of the stance legs.  -->

    The safety-critical control of robotic systems often must account for multiple, potentially conflicting, safety constraints. 
    <!-- This paper proposes novel relaxation techniques to address safety-critical control problems in the presence of conflicting safety conditions.  -->
    In particular, Control Barrier Function (CBFs) provide a means to encode safety as constraints in a Quadratic Program (QP). <!--, wherein multiple safety conditions yield multiple constraints.--> 
    However, the QP problem becomes infeasible when the safety conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. 
    To resolve this potential infeasibility, we introduce a hierarchy between the safety conditions. <!-- and employ an additional variable to relax the less important safety conditions (Relaxed-CBF-QP), and formulate a cascaded structure to achieve smaller violations of lower-priority safety conditions (Hierarchical-CBF-QP). -->
    <!-- The proposed approach, therefore, ensures the existence of at least one solution to the QP problem with the CBFs while dynamically balancing enforcement of additional safety constraints. -->
