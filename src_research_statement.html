    <h2>Research Statement</h2>
        <p class="normal-para">
        <!-- My research goal is to establish a firm foundation that will extend the state-of-the-art methods 
        for designing resilient and intelligent control algorithms for a wide range of legged robot applications. This overview includes
        1) collaborative multi-agent systems with decentralized and distributed control policies,
        2) legged robots with safety-critical control,
        3) trajectory optimization and path planning for various applications on autonomous robots. -->
        My research aim is to develop and unify theoretical frameworks 
        in order to create resilient and intelligent control algorithms, 
        enabling teams of robots to collaborate effectively and safely in human-centered environments. 
        This includes developing decentralized/distributed control for multi-agent systems, 
        autonomous robot control and planning, 
        and cooperation of the robots with safety features.
