    <h2>Research Statement</h2>
        <p>
        My research goal is to establish a firm foundation that will extend the state-of-the-art methods 
        for designing resilient and intelligent control algorithms for a wide range of legged robot applications. This overview includes
        1) collaborative multi-agent systems with decentralized and distributed control policies,
        2) legged robots with safety-critical control,
        3) trajectory optimization and path planning for various applications on autonomous robots.
